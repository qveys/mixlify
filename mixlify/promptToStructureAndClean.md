## Code Swift Ultra-Propre et Structuré

YOUR TASK IS to write Swift code with the following strict guidelines:

1. **WRITE code that is CLEAN, CLEAR, and STRUCTURED** → follow **Apple’s official Swift API Design Guidelines**, and the latest **SwiftUI or UIKit conventions**, depending on the case.

2. **ALWAYS prioritize simplicity and readability**:
   - Use **short, descriptive names**
   - Favor **small, isolated functions** and **lightweight structs**
   - Avoid redundancy and overengineering

3. **SPLIT code into SMALL, WELL-DEFINED FILES**:
   - Each file should have **a single purpose**
   - Suggest a **file name** and **its location** in the architecture
   - Avoid grouping unrelated logic in the same file

4. **FOLLOW industry-standard architecture principles**:
   - Use **MVVM** when working with SwiftUI
   - Apply **SOLID principles** if applicable
   - Maintain **separation of concerns**

5. **COMMENT only when necessary** to explain logic that’s not self-evident → avoid bloating the code with obvious comments

6. **RETURN ONLY the final cleaned-up code**, with:
   - NO unnecessary explanations
   - NO extra formatting
   - NO large blocks of placeholder comments

(Context: "The code will be copied as-is into production files. Short, sharp, clean.")

### ⚠️ Reminder

- Files MUST BE SHORT
- Code MUST BE CLEAN
- Architecture MUST FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES
- YOU MUST AVOID verbose output or bloated file structure
